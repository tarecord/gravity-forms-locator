A Gravity Form add-on that shows a list of forms with the page or post they are published on.

== Description ==

The Gravity Form Locator plugin aims to solve a big hole in the design of Gravity Forms' backend interface.

**Problem:** Currently there is no way to know which page or post a particular form is on.

This plugin solves that problem by adding a "Form Locations" page within the Gravity Forms menu so that all forms that have been added to pages or posts are visible on one screen. Links will take you to the form editor or the post editor so there is one convenient place to manage your forms.

Additionally, when editing a form in the backend, there is a "Locations" tab so you can view all the pages or posts where that form is currently used. It even includes forms located in drafts or private pages.

== Installation ==

Install Gravity Form Locator via the plugin directory, or upload the files manually to your server and follow the on-screen instructions.

**[Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/) version 2.0 or later must be installed for this plugin to work.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin find the forms? =

The plugin will run a scan of all the pages and posts on your site looking for any [gravityforms] shortcodes. If it finds a shortcode, the form and post are added to the "Locations" page in the admin.

= Does the plugin search for forms in widgets? =

Not currently, but if enough people request it, I'll consider adding in that functionality.

= How can I contribute? =
